Started updating this repository to become a dashboard for my IoT projects in order to monitor them remotely. Started refactoring the project into a React app wih client and server sides.

This is the base for a future project I have in mind. For the moment it simply displays the data gathered from an arduino with a motion sensor. Especifically, the movement outside of my house, and stores every event or "movement" in a database. Then we display that data on the webpage, there are 4 graphs. One shows the realtime data as of the moment you enter the page. The other 3 graphs are simply the data gathered since the motion sensor was first activated. The graphs are divided into events per hour, events per day and some statistics like the busiest time of the day / week.
